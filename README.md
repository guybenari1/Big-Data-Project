# Chicago Car Accidents Prediction Using Big Data and Machine Learning

This project aims to predict car accident hotspots in Chicago by leveraging big data technologies and machine learning. The solution includes data ingestion, processing, machine learning, and visualization components.

## Key Features
- Data Ingestion: Simulates live streaming of accident data using Apache Kafka.
- Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses data using Apache Spark.
- Machine Learning: Predicts accident hotspots using Spark MLlib with algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- Visualization: Displays accident hotspots and top 10 dangerous roads in Chicago on an interactive map.

## Tools Used
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Spark Streaming
- Spark MLlib
- Python and Scala
- Tableau or custom visualization tools

## How to Run
